# 5P4C3 5H00T3R*
###### *working development title

We're closing in on the deadline! These are some of the final changes before the *Main Release*:
- Reworked physics to better reflect object states
- Replaced placeholder graphics with (probably) final sprites and background
- Removed deprecated functions and cleaned up code
- All classes moved to separate files
- Added documentation comments
- Developed 3D model to spritesheet pipeline for efficient sprite creation
- Enemies and projectiles now use spritesheets instead of static images

When everything is said and done in the alpha state, this branch will get merged onto main to overwrite old and unused code.
